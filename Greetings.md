# A-Better-Voting-Machine
Salutations to those who set aside some time to read this file.
My name is Javier. As of the time I am writing this, I am currently a first-year software engineering major with a keen interest for open-source projects, AI developement, and data science.
I started this project as I found it necessary to find a way to improve the democratic process in the United States and in the rest of the free world.
Modern voting machines have done wonders for liberal democracies in terms of bolstering the efficiency and the security of the democratic process, but like in all systems, there's always room for some improvement.
This first step in improving modern voting machines, I'd argue, is transparency. It is for that reason that I made the source code for A Better Voting Machine available to the public, and I highly encourage others to modify it in ways they deem necessary.
I acknowledge that voting machine systems are more elaborate than I could possibly imagine. My code serves as both a conceptual model of a data-driven voting system that is simple to understand and likewise a foundation for future modifications.
I hope your contributions to this project is just as fulfilling for you as it was for me when writing the source code.
Thank you for your efforts, and happy coding!
-Javier
